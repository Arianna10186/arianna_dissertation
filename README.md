# arianna_dissertation
All of the code related to the dissertation titled 'The Development of a Digital Twin of a Robotic Therapy Animal Enhanced Through Computer Vision' by Arianna Lloyd. Split up into 4 folders that contain different coding workspaces.

## Emotion Recognition
Used for accessing face-api.js emotion detection and classification algorithm, and sending the results to Unity.

## MatLab Code
Used for defining and exporting GRETA's URDF.

## Person Detection Training
Used for data preprocessing and training the person detection model. Doesn't include the dataset but this has been referenced in the report.

## Thonny File
Connects to a Raspberry Pi Pico and instructs the servo to rotate to the same  head orientation as the simulated robot.

## Unity Files
Within the Unity Assets, there is a folder of scripts containing behaviours attatched to GRETA, and server/clients. Together these combine to control the system.
